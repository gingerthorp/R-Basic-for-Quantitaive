## Question 1 : U.S. CEO Annual Salary Analysis

Problem 1: Find the average salary and the average tenure in the sample.
- average salary of salary: 865.864407($1000)
- average tenure of ceo: 7.954802(years)

Problem 2: How many CEOs are in their first year as CEO (that is,ceoten =0)? 
- first year as CEO: 5(people)
- ceo's longest tunure is : 37(year)

Problem 3: Estimate the simple regression model 
- coefficient estimates: 6.505498
- standard errors: 0.6038
- Multiple R-squared:  0.01316
- predicted percentage increase: 0.9724%

## Question 2 : Analyze the relationship between participation and generosity in 401(k) pension plans.

Problem 1: Find the average participation rate and the average match rate in the sample of plans.
- average participation rate : 87.362907(%)
- average match rate : 0.731512(%)

Problem 2: Estimate the simple regression model
- coefficient estimates: 83.0755
- standard errors: 16.09
- Multiple R-squared:  0.0747

Problem 3: Interpret the intercept in your equation. Interpret the coefficient on mrate.
- Intercept of the equation : 83.075455
- Coefficient of the equation : 5.861079

Problem 4: Find the predicted prate when mrate =3.5. Is this a reasonable prediction? Explain what is happening here.
- predicted prate when mrate=3.5? : 103.589233
- 데이터상에서 prate는 전체에 대한 비율이므로 최대치가 100을 넘을 수 없기 때문에 타당한 예측이라고 할 수 없습니다.

Problem 5: How much of the variation inprate is explained by mrate ? Is this a lot in your opinion?
- Multiple R-squared가 0.0747으로 7.47% 데이터만 모델에 의해 설명되고,  92.53% 데이터는 회귀식으로 설명할 수 없는 error로 추정치의 신뢰도가 낮습니다.


## Question 3 : Consider

Problem 1: Prove whether the OLS estimator of 𝛽1이 unbiased or not.
- Writing

Problem 2: Obtain its variance.
- Writing

Problem 3: Prove whether the OLS estimator of 𝛽1이 consistent or not.
- Writing

Specify the assumptions you need.
