## Question 1 : U.S. CEO Annual Salary Analysis

Problem 1: Find the average salary and the average tenure in the sample.
- average salary of salary: 865.864407($1000)
- average tenure of ceo: 7.954802(years)

Problem 2: How many CEOs are in their first year as CEO (that is,ceoten =0)? 
- first year as CEO: 5(people)
- ceo's longest tunure is : 37(year)

Problem 3: Estimate the simple regression model 
- coefficient estimates: 6.505498
- standard errors: 0.6038
- Multiple R-squared:  0.01316
- predicted percentage increase: 0.9724%

### Question 2 : Analyze the relationship between participation and generosity in 401(k) pension plans.

Problem 1: Find the average participation rate and the average match rate in the sample of plans.
- average participation rate : 87.362907(%)
- average match rate : 0.731512(%)

Problem 2: Estimate the simple regression model
- coefficient estimates: 83.0755
- standard errors: 16.09
- Multiple R-squared:  0.0747

Problem 3: Interpret the intercept in your equation. Interpret the coefficient on mrate.
- Intercept of the equation : 83.075455
- Coefficient of the equation : 5.861079

Problem 4: Find the predicted prate when mrate =3.5. Is this a reasonable prediction? Explain what is happening here.
- predicted prate when mrate=3.5? : 103.589233

Problem 5: How much of the variation inprate is explained by mrate ? Is this a lot in your
- 

### Question 3 : Consider
$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + u_i
$$
Problem 1: Prove whether the OLS estimator of 𝛽1이 unbiased or not.

Problem 2: Obtain its variance.

Problem 3: Prove whether the OLS estimator of 𝛽1이 consistent or not.

Specify the assumptions you need.
